Snake - A modernised clone of the original snake game.

Created using the PYGAME graphic engine for python.

This version of snake has updated, modernised graphics, 2 different levels, and customisable graphics. 

I created this game as my computer science project during 2017.

GAME HELP

Movement is done using the keys W, A, S, D. You cannot turn in the opposite direction (ie: If you are going left you cannot turn right.)

To pause the game, click the purple pause button at the top.
From a paused game, you can resume, enter settings, or go to the home screen.
Note that if you pause the game and go into settings to change the speed, your game will reset.

In order to customise the graphics, go into the ASSETS\IMAGES folder, and directly edit them from there. 
Note that the images you use MUST be exactly the same size as the original images otherwise strange things will happen when 
rendering the game.

The SETTINGS page contains controls for speed, and the level selected. The higher the number of the speed is, the slower
the snake will travel. This is because the speed is actually controlled by a delay between each movement, and
a shorter delay would make it move faster.
