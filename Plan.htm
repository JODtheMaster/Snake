Using module <b> pygame </b>, as well as my Utilities module from an earlier project that I made at home.
</p>
<div class = "layout">
<p>
<p align = "center">
We will create several different <b> .py </b> files for each element of our game. <br />

They will be the:

<style>
ul { text-align:center; }
</style>

<ul style = "square" align = "center">
<li> main </li>
<li> snake </li>
<li> variables </li>
<li> board </li>
<li> graphics </li>
</ul>

</p>
</div>

<div class = "Mudle contents">
<header font size = "20">
<h2> Contents of each file: </h2>
</header>

<p align = "left" font face = "Arial" >
<b> <u> Main </u> </b> <br /> 
This will contain the window creation/updating, exit loop handling, and calls all the 
functions from other modules. This should be quite a short file. <br />

The only functions we will use here are Controller (a class for the entire main loop), the event loop
(which consists of several different files)
<br />

<b> <u> Snake </u> </b> <br />
This module contains the class that holds the data for each snake segment. What we shall do is to
create a segment object in each division of the board.
